            <h2>Interplanetary Explorer Mission - Orbital Mechanics (Team work)</h2>
            <p>This paper presents the development of a mission concept for Earth-to-Earth interplanetary exploration, focusing on orbital mechanics and mission feasibility. The study optimizes the transfer trajectory to a Near-Earth Object (NEO) using the patched conics method, with considerations for flybys and minimizing maneuver costs. The project involves the analysis of time windows for the mission, orbital perturbations from Earth's gravity and solar radiation pressure, and the evolution of Keplerian elements over time. A comparison with real mission data from the IRNSS 1E satellite was conducted to validate the model's accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Definition of Spacecraft Attitude for Correct Pointing - Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics (Team work)</h2>
            <p>The aim of this project is to simulate the behavior of a 6U CubeSat during its orbit. The spacecraft is equipped with a set of gyroscopes, two reaction wheels, and one inertia wheel. The mission's goal is to point towards Aldebaran, a star in the Taurus constellation, during the eclipse phase of its orbit, while charging and transmitting data to Earth during sunlight exposure. The spacecraft's dynamics and environmental disturbances were modeled, alongside the non-ideal behaviors of its sensors and actuators. A control logic was implemented to ensure precise pointing and enable switching between various targets.</p>

            <h2>Engine Sizing and Propellant Selection - Space Propulsion (Team work)</h2>
            <p> In this paper a series of engines for a kick stage of a small satellite (250 kg of dry mass) are
 studied. The rocket has to grant a total ∆v of 2500 m/s. A nominal thrust level of 500 N
 is selected. This value is doubled and halved in a successive analysis in order to compare
 a dimension variation in the engine. The process is repeated for two propellants couples:
 N2H4 −NTO and RP1−H2O2. The second is introduced in order to propose a green
 alternative to the toxic one. The engine shall be realized in additive manufacturing using
 compatible materials, both with the manufacturing techniques and with the adopted
 propellants. For the six engines are sized combustion chambers, injection plates and
 nozzles in addition to pressure-fed feeding lines. It is considered a cooling strategy for the
 engines with a combination of regenerative cooling, radiative cooling and thermal barrier
 coating.</p>

            <h2>Reverse Engineering of the LRO Mission - Space System Engineering and Operations (Team work)</h2>
            <p> In this paper the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission is analyzed from the definition of its main
 objectives to the preliminary sizing of the spacecraft subsystems. The final goal is the identification of
 the mission requirements, through the process of reverse engineering.
 In the first chapter of the paper, the mission goals, functionalities and main phases of the orbiter’s lifetime
 are defined. Also the trajectory design has been analysed in order to validate the ∆v breakdown.
 In the following chapters, all the subsystems are analyzed and a preliminary sizing is performed for each
 case.</p>

            <h2>Design of an Ultra-Rapid Transoceanic Delivery System - Launch System (Team work)</h2>
            <p> The purpose of this report is to present the design of the Fast Logistics Across Suborbital
 Highways (FLASH) ultra-fast transoceanic delivery service, predicated upon the specifica
tions provided by customers. These requirement, includes time-to-market, maximum accel
eration, payload mass, and arrival site,safety of the disposal of the stage , safety on ground
 serve as the foundational criteria for the Conceptual Design. First of all, a baseline is es
tablished through the analysis of the House of Quality (HOQ) , starting from the customer
 requirements and the quality characteristic to be achieved. The study proceed with the mis
sion analysis to fix the mission’s main features. The rocket can be then design: Dimensions,
 Aerodynamics, Propulsion, Recovery, and Weight are evaluated. Finally, the performance
 evaluation of the rocket with its nominal trajectory is provided; an analysis on how the
 possible launch uncertainties can affect the impact point was also carried out, utilizing a
 Montecarlo analysis. Upon completion of the preliminary design and definition of the mis
sion profile, a preliminary requirements review is conducted to assess whether the customer’s
 requirements are met by the obtained results.

            <h2>Assignment 1 - Guidance Navigation and Control</h2>
            <p>This assignment explores advanced orbital mechanics and navigation techniques, including periodic orbits and impulsive guidance. The work involves developing navigation solutions through various methods, such as determining the x-coordinate of the Lagrange point L1, computing periodic halo orbits in the Earth-Moon system, and performing numerical continuation to analyze families of halo orbits. Additionally, impulsive guidance techniques were applied to design a planetary protection strategy for Apophis, focusing on reducing impact risk. The assignment concludes with a time-optimal Earth-Venus transfer problem, utilizing the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) and numerical continuation to optimize the spacecraft’s trajectory.</p>

			<h2>Assignment 2 - Guidance Navigation and Control</h2>
			<p>This assignment delves into uncertainty propagation, batch filters, and sequential filters for spacecraft navigation. The first part involves simulating the propagation of uncertainty for two satellites, Mango and Tango, using methods such as Linearized Covariance, Unscented Transform, and Monte Carlo simulations. The goal was to assess the risk of collision by calculating relative positions and covariance over time, considering various methods for uncertainty estimation.

The second part focuses on batch filtering, where the navigation solution for Mango was computed using ground station data and least squares estimation, with J2 perturbation included for improved accuracy. Different combinations of ground stations were compared to optimize navigation solutions.

The third part applied sequential filtering to estimate the relative state between Mango and Tango for autonomous formation flying, employing an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to process relative measurements and improve state estimation accuracy. The study concluded with the reconstruction of Tango’s absolute covariance using the relative state and covariance of Mango, demonstrating the effectiveness of the sequential filter in dynamic systems.</p>

            <h2>Bibliographic Research on Space Debris Removal - Operation Research</h2>
            <p> In recent decades, the proliferation of space assets has amplified the issue of orbital debris,
 leading to increased risks of collisions among debris and active spacecraft, perpetuating
 the Kessler Syndrome. This paper reviews optimization strategies for debris removal,
 emphasizing methods like Branch and Bound algorithms and stochastic programming.
 These approaches balance computational efficiency with solution optimality, crucial for
 addressing the complexities of debris removal in densely populated orbital regions. The
 study compares methodologies across recent literature, highlighting their effectiveness in
 mitigating debris-related risks and optimizing mission outcomes.</p>
