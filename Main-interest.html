            <h2>Electric Propulsion</h2>
            <p>Electric propulsion is one of my major areas of interest. For about two and a half years, I have been deeply fascinated by the idea that a motor can propel a spacecraft in deep space, along with the physical phenomena behind such engines. I initially explored this field in the "Space Propulsion" course, which provided an introduction to the various types of propulsion systems. In the "Aerothermodynamics" course, I focused on studying the flow of a Self-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic Thruster (SF-MPDT). Since May 2024, I have been working on my thesis in Munich, where I am designing a multimodal propulsion system with a particular focus on the electric propulsion system, specifically an Applied Field Magnetoplasmadynamic Thruster (AF-MPDT).

During this experience, I also had the opportunity to collaborate with the University of Stuttgart, where I participated in testing the SX-3 thruster. This experience has allowed me to interact with leading experts in the field of electric propulsion and beyond.</p>

				 <p> Abstract:The paper describes one-dimensional (1D) flow mathematical model to study the physics of fully ionized plasma flow through Magneto Plasma Dynamic Thruster (MPDT). The developed model consists of a set of differential equations obtained by coupling the Navier–Stokes equations with Maxwell’s equations. These simulations have been carried out for a special case of geometries called Tikhonov fitted geometries for alleviating the instability phenomenon commonly known as onset phenomenon in self-field MPDT. All the computations were carried out in Matlab using a higher order integration scheme.</p>

				<p>This thesis analyzes the design of a multimodal propulsion system with a focus on the electric propulsion system (AF-MPD thruster). For this thruster, I am developing a 0D plasma-thermal model for the design of the cathode, which will be powered by hydrogen. The propellant for the multimodal system is water.
Additionally, a mission analysis code has been developed to assess the benefits of a multimodal system compared to a traditional one. The approach involves using a fuel-optimal strategy based on energy-optimal information.
<br><strong>Note:</strong> The work will be completed by July 2025, and no papers are available at this time. Further details can be provided during an interview.
