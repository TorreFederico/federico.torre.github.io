            <h2>Electric Propulsion</h2>
            <p>Electric propulsion is one of my major areas of interest. For about two and a half years, I have been captivated by the idea that a motor can propel a spacecraft in deep space, and the fascinating physical phenomena behind such engines. I initially explored this field in the "Space Propulsion" course, which introduced me to the various types of propulsion systems. Later, in the "Aerothermodynamics" course, I focused on studying the flow of a Self-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic (SF-MPD) Thruster. Since May 2024, I have been working on my thesis in Munich, where I am designing a multimode propulsion system with a particular focus on the electric propulsion system, specifically an Applied Field Magnetoplasmadynamic Thruster (AF-MPDT).</p>

				 <p class="abstract">The paper describes one-dimensional (1D) flow mathematical model to study the physics of fully ionized plasma flow through Magneto Plasma Dynamic Thruster (MPDT). The developed model consists of a set of differential equations obtained by coupling the Navier–Stokes equations with Maxwell’s equations. These simulations have been carried out for a special case of geometries called Tikhonov fitted geometries for alleviating the instability phenomenon commonly known as onset phenomenon in self-field MPDT. All the computations were carried out in Matlab using a higher order integration scheme.</p>
